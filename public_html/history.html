	  <h2>History of CAMRA</h2>
	  <p>Microbial
risks and the spread of infectious diseases have re-emerged as some of
the greatest concerns for our country&#8217;s safety and security.&nbsp;
Pathogenic viruses, parasites and bacteria continue to threaten our
air, water, soil, food and indoor environments. The ability to measure
and identify these microbial hazards as well as understand their
ability to survive and spread in the environment are the scientific
goals for CAMRA.</p>
	  <p> <strong>CAMRA</strong> (<strong>the Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment</strong>)
is an independent research center originally established by the United States
Department of Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection
Agency, dedicated to advancing laboratory techniques, creating
mathematical tools, and developing datasets needed to improve <strong>Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA), </strong>a
science-based framework for addressing disease in our communities from
intentional or accidental releases of hazardous biological agents into
our indoor and outdoor environments<strong>.</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong>Summarizing
the threats from multiple microorganisms with diverse biologies in
varied scenarios into a comparable estimate &#8211; risk &#8211; is a valuable
product of a QMRA that can help identify the greatest microbial dangers
and set priorities for dealing with <strong>biological  agents of concern </strong>(<strong>BAC</strong>).&nbsp;
QMRA risk estimates are beneficial across many disciplines and used by
groups such as public health specialists, emergency managers, first
responders, regulators, legislators, and engineers employed to assess
and control risk.</p>
	  <p>QMRA required us to look quantitatively at
every step of a microbial exposure pathway, from the first release of a
pathogen to the actual human infection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally,
information had to be gathered on how each microorganism moved through
the environment, their survival rates on various media, and how people
could have been exposed to the microorganism (i.e. skin contact, inhalation, or
ingestion).&nbsp; These measurements gave us a comprehensive view of
how environmental contamination (deliberate or accidental) can lead to
human infection and reveals key points where interventions can be
employed to save lives.&nbsp; Since QMRA allowed us to incorporate
interventions into risk estimates, we can use QMRA as a tool to measure
the impact of interventions and identify the best policies and
practices to protect public health and safety.</p>
	  <p>CAMRA&#8217;s research was divided into five projects,  each specializing in different stages of the QMRA process.</p>

	  <h2>Current  Work</h2>
	  <h4>Project  I &#8211; Exposure: Detection, Fate and Transport of Agents</h4>
	  <p><strong>Gerba Lab, University of Arizona </strong><br />
The Gerba Lab coordinates Project I, and will be measuring the survival
of microbes on skin, and the transfer of microbes between skin and
surfaces.&nbsp; Both these quantities are vital to modeling disease
transmission in the indoor environment.</p>
	  <p><strong>Choi Lab, University  of Arizona </strong><br />
The Choi Lab, located at U of AZ&#8217;s Water Village, is releasing microbes
into a model water distribution system to study microbial
transport.&nbsp; They will compare microbial transport predictions from
the innovative computer models they created in Years 1-3 with the
results of these release experiments.</p>
	  <p><strong>Wagner Lab, Northern Arizona   University</strong> <br />
The Wagner Lab is one of CAMRA&#8217;s two BSL3 (Biosafety level 3)
laboratories, where BAC can be studied directly.&nbsp; Here, surrogates
(harmless microbes that resemble BAC) are evaluated and their survival
rates on surfaces, in soil, and in water are compared to those of the
pathogenic microorganism they resemble.&nbsp; Surrogates that pass
these tests can be used to study BAC scenarios without creating a risk
to human health.</p>
	  <p><strong>Hashsham Lab, Michigan  State University</strong><br />
The Hashsham Lab specializes in studying the recovery and detection of
BAC.&nbsp; They will be sequencing DNA taken from frequently and
infrequently touched surfaces in a University dormitory to test Project
II&#8217;s model of influenza transmission via surfaces and air.&nbsp; They
will also be testing methods to measure anthrax on surfaces using the
surrogate <em>Bacillus  thuringiensis</em>.</p>
	  <p><strong>Nicas Lab, University of California,  Berkeley</strong><br />
The Nicas Lab specializes in aerosol studies.&nbsp; They are testing
mathematical models of particle movement within a room, using data from
an experiment conducted in Year 3.&nbsp; They are also measuring the
amount of particles from a cough that can reach vulnerable areas of the
face (membranes such as the eyes, nasal passages, and mouth).</p>
	  <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
	  <h4>Project  II &#8211; Infectious Disease Models for Assessing Microbial Risks and Developing  Control Strategies</h4>
	  <p><strong>Eisenberg and Koopman Labs, University of Michigan</strong><br />
The Eisenberg and Koopman Labs are incorporating new data from Project
I and Project III into their computer models of infectious disease
transmission in the indoor environment.&nbsp; These models combine
human movement patterns and environmental contamination levels to see
how infections travel in a single venue, multiple venues, and in
regional models.&nbsp; They are also collecting data on influenza and
norovirus outbreaks to test the predictions of their models.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4>Project  III &#8211; Dose-Response Modeling and Application</h4>
	  <p><strong>Haas Lab, Drexel University</strong><br />
The Haas Lab is in charge of creating mathematical dose-response
relationships for BAC using existing data and data from CAMRA
experiments.&nbsp; They have completed dose-response models for the
Category A Biothreat Agents, and are now working on Category B and C
Agents, and USDA Select Agents.&nbsp; They are also exploring the
effect of multiple doses and timing of doses on microbial risks.</p>
	  <p><strong>Bolin    Lab</strong><strong>, Michigan</strong><strong> State University</strong><br />
CAMRA&#8217;s second BSL3 lab, the Bolin Lab performs animal studies to
obtain dose-response data for BAC when datasets are not available from
the scientific literature.&nbsp; They are currently conducting
experiments to provide multiple dose and time-to-dose response data.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4>Project  IV &#8211; The Assessment-Analysis Interface for QMRA</h4>
	  <p><strong>Gurian Lab, Drexel University</strong><br />
The Gurian lab explores innovative ways to apply QMRA concepts to risk
management and decision-making.&nbsp; They are currently using Bayesian
Hierarchical Analysis to identify general trends in interspecies
survival and dose-response data, developing risk analysis scenarios for
<em>Tularemia</em> and pandemic influenza, and factoring risk into  cost-benefit analysis for decision models.</p>
	  <p><strong>Casman Lab, Carnegie Mellon   University</strong><br />
The Casman Lab is creating a methodology for evaluating the public&#8217;s
beliefs about microbial threats and identifying potentially dangerous
misconceptions.&nbsp; This methodology is being tested with regards to
beliefs about influenza by taking concepts from semi-structured
interviews and developing a national survey to identify the frequency
of these beliefs in the general population.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <h4>Project  V &#8211; Knowledge Management, Transfer, and Learning for the QMRA Community</h4>
	  <p><strong>Weber Lab, Drexel University</strong><br />
The Weber Lab is finalizing the second version of CAMRA&#8217;s knowledge
repository, an online data storage and knowledge sharing system that
facilitates collaboration between CAMRA researchers and highlights
connections between projects.&nbsp; They are also building the core
software for the CAMRA Data Warehouse, which will contain the assembled
QMRA data from five years of CAMRA research and allow future users to
add to it, forming a persistent and growing QMRA resource.</p>
	  <p><strong>Rose Lab, Michigan State University</strong><br />
The Rose lab is in charge of QMRA Education, prepares QMRA workshops
for conferences, and hosts the 1-Week QMRA Summer Institute at Michigan
State University.&nbsp; They also use data and tools developed by all
CAMRA projects and will be completing risk assessments for fomites and
key pathogens including the norovirus and &nbsp;<em>Salmonella</em>.&nbsp;
They are currently focusing on beach safety after a sewage spill and
waterborne disease after a flood, as well as compiling key QMRA data
sets for the CAMRA Data Warehouse.</p>
