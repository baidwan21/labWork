      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>CAMRAhas twin missions. The first is a technical mission to have developed 
        critically reviewed and interpreted sets of models, tools and information 
        that will be used in a credible risk assessment framework to reduce or 
        eliminate health impacts from deliberate use of biological agents of concern 
        (BAC) as bioterrorists agents in the indoor and outdoor environment. The 
        second mission is to build a national network for MRA for knowledge management, 
        learning and transfer, for the community of scientists, community of students 
        via educational programs and community of professionals in the field and 
        in our communities.</p>

      <p>CAMRA is a consortium of scientists who have extensive expertise in quantitative 
        microbial risk assessment (MRA) methods, bio-security, and infectious 
        disease transmission through environmental exposures. CAMRA has two main 
        goals. The first is a technical mission to develop critically reviewed 
        and interpreted sets of models, tools, and information that will be used 
        in a credible risk assessment framework to reduce or eliminate health 
        impacts from deliberate use of biological agents of concern (BAC) as bioterrorist 
        agents in the indoor and outdoor environment. The second mission is to 
        build a national MRA network for knowledge management, learning, and transfer 
        for scientists, students, and professionals in the field and in our communities. 
        There are five major research projects which will define the objectives 
        and activities of CAMRA. Each project objective has been developed through 
        collaborative efforts of scientists and will be integrated via a management 
        structure that facilitates interaction. These research projects address 
        exposure, methods and models; dose-response; population outcomes; risk 
        frameworks; and knowledge management, transfer and learning. Through these 
        projects we will:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Document the sensitivity and specificity of risk exposure methods 
          and their ability to address levels of safety;</li>
        <li>Create a research toolbox with validated surrogates for BAC;</li>
        <li>Evaluate the fate and transport of bioterrorist agents in water distribution 
          systems, air, and buildings;</li>
        <li>Develop a suite of models for characterizing exposure via aerosols 
          and the indoor environment that are validated with real-world data where 
          available, describing disease transmission through dynamic stochastic 
          and deterministic models, and assessing controls such as vaccines, decontamination, 
          and quarantines; and</li>
        <li>Produce an inventory of critically analyzed dose-response relationships 
          for Category A agents and mechanistic dose-response models.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Overall these projects will focus on assessment, lessons learned, new 
        science and research, databases, tools and methods and finally knowledge 
        building for learning and communication purposes. We anticipate that CAMRA 
        will produce a suite of outcomes for government officials and first responders 
        as well as the research, education, and professional communities.</p>
