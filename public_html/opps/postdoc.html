      	<h2>Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment (CAMRA) Post-doctoral and Doctoral Fellowship Announcement</h2>
      	<p>The Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment (CAMRA; a $10 million Cooperative Center recently funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Homeland Security) at Michigan State University invites applications for post-doctoral and doctoral fellowships working in microbial risk-related sciences. Center's mission is to fill critical gaps in microbial risk assessment framework needed to support the security objectives of EPA and DHS. More specifically it aims to: i) improve our ability to measure exposure to biological agents of concerns in drinking water and indoor air, ii) develop a methodology that links models of environmental exposure and models of disease process to help with early detection outbreaks and control efforts, iii) produce a reference set of information on the does and subsequent response for specific bioterrorist agents, iv) identify research strategies and risk communication priorities that can improve how society manages bioterrorism risk, and v) develop educational programs, online learning tools,  and workshops to increase knowledge about microbial risk assessment.</p>
		
		<p>Post-doctoral fellows will be supported for two years minimum plus benefits and will be matched with CAMRA host faculty working on projects related to priority research areas. Post-doctoral applicants should have a PhD in a relevant field. Doctoral applicants will be recruited through the appropriate departments with doctoral assistantships stipends provided per month plus tuition and fringe benefits). Applicants should have undergraduate and/or MS, PhD degrees in a field that provides the basic foundations to work in the area of microbiology, risk assessment, microbial environmental transport, epidemiology or related fields. Applications will be accepted until positions are filled; review of applications begin January 2006. Applicants who are not US citizens or permanent residents must provide documentation evidencing employment authorization in the US. Interested individuals should prepare (1) a letter of application, (2) curriculum vitae, (3) names and contact information of three references, and (4) a statement describing your research interests and goals, professional experience, and how they relate to the mission and priority research area(s) of CAMRA.
