					<p>Water quality models are widely used in analyses of water distribution systems.  These network models have been used quite successfully for operational purposes, but in the context of providing real-time response for contamination events, the general mixing assumptions are most likely inadequate.  Water security has been a concern of the water distribution community for several years, and it has become apparent that additional accuracy is critical to properly develop real-time response tools, especially if in-situ sensor equipment will be used to help detect intrusions.  Current models assume instantaneous and complete mixing at pipe junctions and several studies have contributed to growing evidence that this assumption may be inadequate.  The 'complete' mixing assumption becomes especially questionable at pipe cross junctions, where there may be limited contact and retention time between the water flows in two incoming pipe legs.  The impact of solute mixing at these intersections, geometric components of a network system, is the focus of this work. Our computational and experimental results clearly indicate that mixing at pipe cross junctions is far from 'perfect'.  Incomplete mixing results from bifurcating inlet flows that reflect off one another with minimal contact time.  Improving the existing water quality model based on accurate mixing data and simulations is important not only to predict concentrations of chemical species such as chlorine in water distribution systems, but also to prepare for potential intentional and accidental contamination events.</p>

                    <p> The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human  infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 12-year-old male from Tangerang  District in Banten Province developed symptoms on 30 September and is  currently in hospital. The investigation team found that he had direct  contact with dead chicken near his school in the days before his  illness.</p>
                    <p> Of the 109 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 87 have been fatal.</p>

                    <h3>Cholera in Iraq</h3>
                    <p> Since the cholera  outbreak was first detected in Kirkuk, Northern Iraq, on 14 August  2007, it has spread to 9 out of 18 provinces across Iraq. It is  estimated that more than 30 000 people have fallen ill with acute  watery diarrhoea, among which 3 315 were identified as positive for <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>,  the bacterium causing the disease. A total of 14 people are known to  have died of the disease. The case-fatality rate has remained low  throughout the outbreak indicating that those who have become sick have  been able to access adequate treatment on time.</p>
                    <p> The disease is continuing to spread across Iraq and dissemination to as  yet unaffected areas remains highly possible. Epidemiological curves  are still rising in the provinces from which the majority of  laboratory-confirmed cases have originated, Kirkuk (2309) and  Sulaymaniah (870). An increasing number of cases of acute watery  diarrhoea has also been reported in Diala, a province neighbouring  Baghdad. Although <em>V. cholerae</em> has not yet been laboratory  confirmed, the clinical symptoms indicate the presence of cholera. The  numbers of cases are remaining stable in Basra, Baghdad, Dahuk, Mosul  and Tikrit. However, a case has now been confirmed in Wasit, a province  that has previously been unaffected by the outbreak.</p>
