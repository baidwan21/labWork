    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
The present study investigates solute mixing phenomena at various flow
rates within a cross junction, which is commonly found in municipal
drinking water distribution systems. Simulations using computational
fluid dynamics are employed to model the solute concentrations leaving
the junction when one inlet is comprised of clean water while the other
inlet carries a solute at R&gt;10,000. For a few exemplary cases, the
resulting velocity vectors and contours of dimensionless concentration
are presented to explain the detailed mixing mechanisms at the
impinging interface. The turbulent Schmidt number (Sc<em>t</em>), an important scaling parameter, is also evaluated. Experimental results were used to assess values of Sc<em>t</em>
for various flow conditions that accurately captured the detailed
mixing processes within the junction. The present study clearly
indicates that mixing at pipe cross junctions is far from &#8220;perfect.&#8221;
Incomplete mixing results from bifurcating inlet flows that reflect off
one another with minimal contact time. Improving the existing water
quality model based on accurate mixing data and simulations is
important not only to predict concentrations of chemical species such
as chlorine in water distribution systems, but also to prepare for
potential intentional and accidental contamination events. </p>

ASCE Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management 134(3):295-302. </p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
The present experimental study focuses on the characterization of
complex mixing phenomena at pipe intersections within pressurized water
distribution networks. To examine the complete mixing assumption at a
cross junction, a series of experiments were conducted in the turbulent
regime (R&gt;10,000). The experimental setup consists of a cross
junction with various sensors, pumps, and a data acquisition system to
accurately measure solute concentration. Selected experimental results
are compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results. In
addition, the water quality model associated with a standard water
distribution network simulator (EPANET) was reevaluated based on CFD
and experimental data. Corrections based on experimental results are
incorporated into EPANET (AZRED 1.0) for use in a case study. The study
concludes that the complete mixing assumption can potentially create
considerable errors in water quality modeling. Further, severe errors
are likely to occur in systems with many cross type junctions due to
bifurcation of the incoming flows. </p>

P22 and Staphylococcus aureus Attenuation on Nonporous Fomites as

    <p><em>Abstract</em>: Decay rates of bacteriophage P22 and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>
on six types of common household inanimate surfaces were evaluated
based on cultivation and quantitative PCR. A much higher level of
inactivation was observed using the plate assay, suggesting that
detection of the pathogen genome in samples from fomites does not
necessarily imply a health risk to humans.</p>

    <p><em>Abstract</em>: Because experiments with <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>
are costly and dangerous, the scientific, public health, and
engineering communities are served by thorough collation and analysis
of experiments reported in the open literature. This study identifies
available dose-response data from the open literature for inhalation
exposure to B. anthracis and, via dose-response modeling, characterizes
the response of nonhuman animal models to challenges. Two studies
involving four data sets amenable to dose-response modeling were found
in the literature: two data sets of response of guinea pigs to
intranasal dosing with the Vollum and ATCC-6605 strains, one set of
responses of rhesus monkeys to aerosol exposure to the Vollum strain,
and one data set of guinea pig response to aerosol exposure to the
Vollum strain. None of the data sets exhibited overdispersion and all
but one were best fit by an exponential dose-response model. The
beta-Poisson dose-response model provided the best fit to the remaining
data set. As indicated in prior studies, the response to aerosol
challenges is a strong function of aerosol diameter. For guinea pigs,
the LD50 increases with aerosol size for aerosols at and above 4.5 &#956;m.
For both rhesus monkeys and guinea pigs there is about a 15-fold
increase in LD50 when aerosol size is increased from 1 &#956;m to 12 &#956;m.
Future experimental research and dose-response modeling should be
performed to quantify differences in responses of subpopulations to B.
anthracis and to generate data allowing development of interspecies
correction factors.</p>

    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
This article develops dose-response models for Lassa fever virus using
data sets found in the open literature. Dose-response data were drawn
from two studies in which guinea pigs were given subcutaneous and
aerosol exposure to Lassa virus. In one study, six groups of inbred
guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with doses of Lassa virus
and five groups of out-bred guinea pigs were similarly treated. We
found that the out-bred subcutaneously exposed guinea pig did not
exhibit a dose-dependent trend in response. The inbred guinea pigs data
were best fit by an exponential dose-response model. In a second study,
four groups of out-bred guinea pigs were exposed to doses of Lassa
virus via the aerosol route. In that study, aerosol diameter was less
than 4.5 &#956; m and both mortality and morbidity were used as endpoints.
The log-probit dose-response model provided a somewhat better fit than
the Beta-Poisson model for data with mortality as the endpoint, but the
Beta-Poisson is considered the best fit model because it can be derived
using biological considerations. Morbidity data were best fit with an
exponential dose-response model.</p>

    <p><em>Abstract</em>: The objective of this study was development of a dose-response model for exposure to <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em>
in different animal hosts and analysis of the results. The data sets
with which the model was developed were taken from the open literature.
All data sets were initially tested for a trend between dose and
outcome using the Cochran-Armitage test. Only data showing a
statistically significant trend were subjected to further analysis
(fitting with parametric dose-response relationships). Dose-response
relationships (exponential, beta-Poisson and log-probit) were fit to
data using the method of maximum likelihood estimation. Dose-response
analysis of BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, guinea pigs and diabetic rats
showed that BALB/c mice exposed intranasally (i.n.) and guinea pigs
exposed intraperitoneally (i.p.) are significantly more sensitive to <em>B. pseudomallei</em>
than C57BL/6 mice exposed i.n. and diabetic rats exposed i.p. The
results confirmed the findings of a study of outbreak data that the
diabetic population is more susceptible to infection with <em>B. pseudomallei</em>
than the general population. The low dose prediction from best fit
dose-response models can be used to draw guidelines for public health
decision making processes, including consideration of sensitive
subpopulations.</p>

    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
We create an influence diagram of how a plague bioattack could unfold
and then use it to identify factors shaping infection risks in many
possible scenarios. The influence diagram and associated explanations
provide a compact reference that allows risk communicators to identify
key messages for pre-event preparation and testing. It can also be used
to answer specific questions in whatever unique situations arise,
considering both the conditions of the attack and the properties of the
attacked populations. The influence diagram allows a quick, visual
check of the factors that must be covered when evaluating audience
information needs. The documentation provides content for explaining
the resultant advice. We show how these tools can help in preparing for
crises and responding to them.</p>

In: Advances in Case-Based Reasoning: Proceedings of the European
Conference on Case-Based Reasoning. Althoff, K.-D., R. Bergmann, M.
Minor, and A. Hanft, eds. pp. 548-561. Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg.</p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
We present a new case representation that seeks to make case-based
reasoning (CBR) more suited to real world applications. We propose a
horizontal representation that is composed of two features, one to
represent the problem and one to represent the solution. We also
present a similarity metric tailored to our representation. Rather than
parametrizing the distance function with weights, it requires one
parameter that recommends the cardinality of values for new problems to
be solved by the system. Our representation is less restrictive during
case acquisition as it does not constrain how non-experts can populate
cases and it requires less knowledge engineering effort than the
traditional method. We compare our representation to the traditional
case representation and show that it is superior when cases are
incomplete. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our
representation in a real world application, where the demarcation
between problem and solution is blurred.</p>

    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
Expert locators and repository-based knowledge management systems (KMS)
are different architectures proposed to perform different kinds of
knowledge management functions. While expert locators can recommend an
expert to perform a task, repository- based KMS can share a learned
strategy to solve a given problem. In this paper, we describe a
framework to develop KMS that can perform multifunctional tasks,
usually performed by repository-based and expert locators separately,
in one single architecture. The proposed framework follows principles
from knowledge engineering and from the management literature on how to
prevent failure in KMS. We illustrate the proposed framework with an
implementation to support a community of science.</p>

Rose.&nbsp;2009. <strong>Characterizing the Risk of Infection       from <em>Mycobacterium</em> <em>tuberculosis</em> in Commercial       Passenger Aircraft using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment</strong>.&nbsp; Risk Analysis (In press).</p>
    <p><em>Abstract</em>:
Quantitative microbial risk assessment was used to predict the
likelihood and spatial organization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
transmission in a commercial aircraft. Passenger exposure was predicted
via a multizone Markov model in four scenarios: seated or moving
infectious passengers and with or without filtration of recirculated
cabin air. The traditional exponential (k= 1) and a new exponential (k=
0.0218) dose-response function were used to compute infection risk.
Emission variability was included by Monte Carlo simulation. Infection
risks were higher nearer and aft of the source; steady state airborne
concentration levels were not attained. Expected incidence was low to
moderate, with the central 95% ranging from 10&#8722;6 to 10&#8722;1 per 169
passengers in the four scenarios. Emission rates used were low compared
to measurements from active TB patients in wards, thus a
"superspreader" emitting 44 quanta/h could produce 6.2 cases or more
under these scenarios. Use of respiratory protection by the infectious
source and/or susceptible passengers reduced infection incidence up to
one order of magnitude.</p>
